Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning with GRPO for Medical Reasoning
==================================================================

Overview
--------

This project demonstrates **how to fine-tune a language model using GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)** specifically for medical reasoning tasks. By leveraging custom reward functions and a specialized medical reasoning dataset, we transform a general-purpose language model into a domain-specific medical reasoning model. Note that the information provided here is intended solely for educational purposes and cannot substitute for professional medical advice.

Launching the Project on CAI
----------------------------

This AMP was developed against Python 3.10. There are two ways to launch the project on CAI:

1.  From Prototype Catalog - Navigate to the AMPs tab on a CML workspace, select the "Build Your Own Medical Reasoning Model" tile, click "Launch as Project", click "Configure Project"
2.  As an AMP - In a CML workspace, click "New Project", add a Project Name, select "AMPs" as the Initial Setup option, copy in this repo URL, click "Create Project", click "Configure Project"

* * * * *

Project Workflow
----------------

1.  **Load Pre-trained Model**
2.  **Prepare the Dataset**
3.  **Define Reward Functions & Verifiers**
4.  **Simulate GRPO Training Run**
5.  **Evaluate Model Checkpoint**
6.  **Run Inference with Fine-tuned Model**

* * * * *

Key Features
------------

### Flexible Model Selection

-   Support for multiple base models:
    -   Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct (default)
    -   Qwen2.5
    -   Phi-4
    -   Gemma 3

### Advanced Fine-Tuning Technique

-   **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**
    -   Rewards desired output features
    -   Improves model responses through custom feedback
    -   Maintains model stability during optimization

### Customizable Reward Functions

-   Evaluate model outputs for:
    -   Correctness (semantic alignment with references)
    -   Response formatting (e.g., tag presence)
    -   Clinical accuracy (evaluated via perplexity)

* * * * *

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10+
-   GPU with minimum 5GB VRAM (for models ≤1.5B parameters)
-   Recommended runtime: 4vCPU, 16GB RAM, 1 GPU 

### Project Setup

1.  Open `starter_notebook.ipynb`
2.  Run setup cells to install dependencies
3.  Review reward function configurations
4.  **(Optional)** Trigger full GRPO training (≈ 3 hours with preset configs)

* * * * *

Usage Guide
-----------

### Quick Start

1.  Use provided pre-trained checkpoint for demo
2.  Customize base model and dataset paths easily – just change the model or dataset in the notebook
3.  Adjust reward functions as needed

### Fine-Tuning Workflow

1.  Prepare your training dataset
2.  Define reward functions
3.  Configure training parameters
4.  Run GRPO training

### Example: Training Dataset Preparation

```
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load medical reasoning dataset
dataset = load_dataset('your/medical/dataset')

# Prepare system prompt
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
Respond in the following format:
<reasoning>
...
</reasoning>
<answer>
...
</answer>
"""

```

Advanced Customization
----------------------

### Swap in Different Base Models

To switch models, update this line in the notebook:

```
model_name = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct" 
# Swap with another supported base model 
# model_name = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B" 
# model_name = "microsoft/Phi-4" 
# model_name = "google/gemma-3-1b-it"
```

All training and evaluation logic works across supported architectures with minimal changes.

### Swap in New Datasets Easily

Just replace the dataset loading line:

```
dataset = load_dataset('your/medical/dataset')
# Swap with another dataset:
# dataset = load_dataset('your/specific/dataset')
```

Make sure the new dataset provides prompt--response pairs or can be adapted using preprocessing (examples provided in the notebook).

### Custom Reward Functions

Plug in new reward functions as needed:

-   The notebook includes modular functions for correctness, formatting, and quality
-   Easily extendable to include factuality checks, custom verifiers and more

* * * * *

Fine-Tuning Considerations
--------------------------

-   Compute-intensive process (≈ 3 hours with default config)
-   Pre-trained checkpoints available for quick testing
-   Workflow is modular and fully customizable

* * * * *

Reward Function Examples
------------------------

-   **Correctness Reward**: Compare model output to reference answer
-   **Format Reward**: Ensure XML-like response structure
-   **Quality Reward**: Validate output fluency via perplexity scoring

* * * * *

Performance Optimization
------------------------

-   Uses LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning
-   Supports mixed-precision training (bfloat16/fp16)
-   Configurable batch sizes, training schedule and gradient accumulation

* * * * *

Recommended Next Steps
----------------------

-   Experiment with different reward function designs. The notebook contains examples with semantic correctness, perplexity and tag presence.
-   Test model performance across various medical reasoning scenarios.
-   Try custom base models and new datasets
